# Neural Network Architecture
The selected neural network is a fully connected multilayer perceptron with 5 hidden layers. The number of neurons per layer has not yet been selected. The implementation is designed around clarity and object oriented design, but is not the most efficient. The neurons could be represented as matrices and vectors of data such as weights, biases, and outputs. This would allow for SIMD calculation, compute shaders, and/or more easily multithreaded execution.
