# Software-Portfolio
If you're seeing this, thanks for taking an interest in my work! Each of the top level folders in this repository represents a software development project that I worked on in 2024/2025.

Due to academic conduct concerns, I cannot share the full code base for projects completed during my Master's. However, I have been authorised to share code snippets.

Please excuse the lack of detail in the dissertation project, that project is ongoing and expected to finish in early September 2025.
