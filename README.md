# Software-Portfolio
If you're seeing this, thanks for taking an interest in my work! Each of the top level folders in this repository represents a software development project that I worked on in 2024-2026. </br>

My most recent work is in [Incremental Dungeon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4213380/Incremental_Dungeon/), a game I published on Steam in 2026. You can find the source code
(with CC0 license) in Incremental Dungeon's respective folder.</br>

If you're more interested in C++ code and engineless programming, I recommend looking at Physics Simulation and 2.5D platformer, which were essentially the final projects for the first and second trimester of my graduate
degree.

# Biography
I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering in 2023 at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. I completed my MSc. in Computer Games Programming with a
distinction in 2025 at the University of Hull, UK. </br>

After completing my MSc, I began job hunting. Many of the job listings I saw were looking for developers experienced in engines such as Unreal and Unity, so I decided to learn 
these engines to stand out more as an applicant. I had an idea for a game I wanted to create, decided Godot would be the best engine for that game, and got to work. 4 months 
later, I released my first Steam game, [Incremental Dungeon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4213380/Incremental_Dungeon/).</br>

I am now actively looking for a full time software development position,
and my next game is expected to be a Vampire Survivors clone built with Unreal.
