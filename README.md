# Software-Portfolio
If you're seeing this, thanks for taking an interest in my work! Each of the top level folders in this repository represents a software development project that I worked on in 2024/2025. </br>

The best place to start is Incremental Dungeon, a game I'm developing in Godot that is expected to release on Steam and Itch.io in Q4 2025-Q1 2026. </br>

If you're more interested in C++ code and engineless programming, I recommend looking at Physics Simulation and 2.5D platformer, which were essentially the final projects for the first and second trimester of my graduate
degree.

# Biography
I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering in 2023 at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. I expect to complete my graduate degree in Computer Games Programming with a
distinction in 2026 at the University of Hull, UK. </br> </br>
My graduate programme primarily focused on high performance engineless/custom engine C++ programming and DirectX11. Having seen that companies are looking for developers experienced in 
engines such as Unreal and Unity, I'm currently learning to work with such engines full time. To learn these engines, I am (slowly) using them to create new games, which you can find on my itch.io: https://nauphy.itch.io/
