# Software-Portfolio
If you're seeing this, thanks for taking an interest in my work! Each of the top level folders in this repository represents a software development project that I worked on in 2024/2025.

I apologize for the lack of source code in these folders, but I am concerned about potential plagerism/copyright violations in sharing code that I wrote for my school projects. The mod I created (Mod for Battle Brothers) does actually contain code, since that was not a university project.

Please excuse the lack of detail in the dissertation project, that project is ongoing and expected to finish in early September 2025.
