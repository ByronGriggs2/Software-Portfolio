# Training a Neural Network to Play a Skill Based Game
## Overview
The goal of this project was to create a neural network with random weights and train it to play the game Awaria with exceptional skill. At an early stage the project was split up into the following sub goals, in rough chronological order.
1. Select, with well researched justification, a neural network architecture and training algorithm (prototype complete)
2. With minimal gameplay alterations, modify the game such that the gameplay state can be read and inputs can be sent by an autonomous application (in progress)
3. Implement an interface and training algorithm to connect the game and the network (planned)
4. Ensure that each part of the system is working correctly, so that the next step does not need to be redone
5. Train the neural network via reinforcement learning
6. Evaluate the trained network and compare to human gameplay

As of 9th June, 2025, this project is still in development, expected to finish in early September 2025.
