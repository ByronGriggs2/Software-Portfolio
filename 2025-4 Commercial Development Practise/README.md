# Commercial Development Practise (Sept 2024-Apr 2025)
## Introduction
The software created by this project and details of its use are intellectual property of the University, but the course it was done for is not. Commercial Development Practise (CDP) is a module where students complete
work for real corportations free of charge, in exchange for use as an education tool in an academic environment. Some examples of documentation from the project are included in this directory.
## What is CDP?
Commercial Development Practise (CDP) is a course meant to simulate a real software engineering work environment. 
Students are separated into groups and given projects with real commercial value. 
Students then meet for typically 7, but sometimes up to 35 hours a week to work on the project together in the provided office space. 
The module emphasizes industry standards and DevOps development, and students are evaluated on their business management practises rather than the quality of their software. 
## What did I learn?
The most valuable things I learned were in the tools and practises we used. The use of PRINCE2 and Agile/Scrum methodologies were paramount, and I gained experience in related servant-leader positions such as scrum master. I also gained experience with Azure DevOps, version control, and sprints. The group extensively used Unity and C# for this project as well.
## What were my marks?
My grade for the course was 86% (An overall mark/grade of 70% is distinction/honours in the UK).
