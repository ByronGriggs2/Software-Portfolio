# 2.5D Platformer
## Introduction
This was my final project for the C++ Programming and Design and Real Time Graphics courses of my master's programme. The goal was to use DirectX 11 3D to render a simple platform game. The only libraries permitted were ImGui, DDS Texture loader, and the C++ standard library.  

My mark for the course was 69% (An overall mark/grade of 70% is distinction/honours in the UK).
## Video demonstration
As part of the project I was asked to create a simple (and rushed) demonstration video that adheres closely to the rubric. You can see it here: https://youtu.be/I9qXg2hOkvQ
