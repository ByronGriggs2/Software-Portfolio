# Instructions
Unlike the Physics Simulation, the 2.5D platformer must be compiled and launched from Visual Studio. Once launched, controls can be found in the upper right corner.

# Code Snippets
The "Code Snippets" folder was originally created to show off source code without any risk of violating the academic integrity policy of my University. After the last graded assignment from the 
programme was submitted, I uploaded the source code in full. The code snippets folder was retained because it gives a convenient overview of certain major details.
