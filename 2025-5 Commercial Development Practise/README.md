# Commercial Development Practise (Sept 2024-Apr 2025)
## Introduction
For other projects, while I didn't necessarily provide code, I provided class diagrams and descriptions of the implementation and functionality of the design.
In this case, however, I can't even provide that much, as the details of the project are considered University property. Fortunately, the actual software isn't what CDP is all about!
## What is CDP?
Commercial Development Practise (CDP) is a course meant to simulate a real software engineering work environment. Students are separated into groups and given projects with real commercial value. Students then meet for typically 7, but sometimes up to 35 hours a week to work on the project together in the provided office space. Students are expected to utilize PRINCE2 and Agile, frequently communicate with clients, conduct sprints, and use Azure DevOps. 
## What did I learn?
The most valuable things I learned were in the tools and practises we used. The use of PRINCE2 and Agile/Scrum methodologies were paramount, and I gained experience in related servant-leader positions such as scrum master. I also gained experience with Azure DevOps, version control, and sprints. The group extensively used Unity and C# for this project as well.
## What were my marks?
My grade for the course was 86% (An overall mark/grade of 70% is distinction/honours in the UK).
