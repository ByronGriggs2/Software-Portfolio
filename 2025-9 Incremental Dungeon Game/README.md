# Incremental Dungeon Game
After finishing my graduate dissertation, I started working on a game using the Godot engine and GDScript. This game is still in the early stages of development,
but I plan on releasing regular updates on its itch.io page here: https://nauphy.itch.io/incremental-dungeon-game </br> </br>

Incremental Dungeon Game is definitely a working title, but I kind of like it, and I might keep it. It's a text-based RPG/incremental game, heavily inspired by
other text or UI based incremental games like Your Chronicle, Idling to Rule The Gods, Magic Research, and Untitled Space Sim. I hope to make this game stand out
by placing less focus on prestige and much more focus on simultaneous party based combat. Combat is to be a 5v5 autobattler with customisable ability rotations. </br> </br> 

Every time I release a new version of the game on itch.io, I will update the source code in this repository. The application itself is too large to upload to GitHub.
