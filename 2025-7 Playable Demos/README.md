I made this tic tac toe demo specifically for the portfolio. The AI is theoretically perfect, but it's difficult to know for sure.
It never loses and wins 91% of the time against a random opponent, though. </br>

The win rate test is still in there, and can be enabled by adding #DEFINE TEST to helpers.h.
