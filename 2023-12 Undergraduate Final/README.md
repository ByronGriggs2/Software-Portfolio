As my undergraduate degree is in computer engineering, this is not a pure software project, but rather uses embedded systems.

The project was to program an M5Stack Core2 microcontroller and multiple M5Stick C-Plus microcontrollers to serve as a reminder system to prevent users from forgetting personal items. It works similarly to airtag, though it also warns you if you open your door without the personal item on your person. 

As this is a computer engineering degree, the code exhibits poor object oriented design but extremely low level programming.
