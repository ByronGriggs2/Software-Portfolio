# Instructions
The application is ready to launch, but it is located in /Visual Studio/x64/Release/SimulationSandBox1.exe. This is necessary for the application to function. Alternatively you can always recompile and launch it from
the Visual Studio solution. Just make sure you are compiling with "SimulationSandBox" as the startup project. To change this, right click on "SimulationSandBox" and select "Set as startup project".
Once launched, you can move the camera with WASD and load different physics scenarios.

# Code Snippets
The "Code Snippets" folder was originally created to show off source code without any risk of violating the academic integrity policy of my University. After the last graded assignment from the 
programme was submitted, I uploaded the source code in full. The code snippets folder was retained because it gives a convenient overview of certain major details.
